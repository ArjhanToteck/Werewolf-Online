<h1 data-text="Bloodhound" class="glitch">Bloodhound</h1>

Bloodhounds, like all other members of the wolfpack, have the ability to communicate privately with other wolfpack members at night and kill another player every night, though only one member of the wolfpack can kill per night.

Unlike other werewolves, however, bloodhounds have the ability to check the exact role of any living player during the night.

<h2 data-text="Additional Commands" class="glitch">Additional Commands</h2>

<li>During the night, use the command <c>!check (username)</c> to find out the role of the chosen player. The moderator will tell you what the faction is in the morning.</li>

<li>During the night, use the command <c>!kill (username)</c> to take the wolfpack kill and murder the chosen player.</li>

<h2 data-text="Role Type" class="glitch">Role Type</h2>

<li>Bloodhounds are members of the wolfpack faction.</li>
<li>Bloodhounds are seen as members of the wolfpack by the seer.</li>

<h2 data-text="Tips" class="glitch">Tips</h2>
<li>Bloodhounds are capable of pretending to be seers. Just remember that, unlike you, seers can only see factions, and not exact roles.</li>
