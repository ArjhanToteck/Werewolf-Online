Avengers are villagers with fire in their souls. When an avenger dies, they also kill the person that killed them, which protection from a <a href="protector.html">protector</a> or <a href="martyr.html">martyr</a> cannot prevent. If they were voted off, a random person who voted for them will die.

<h2 data-text="Role Type" class="glitch">Role Type</h2>

<li>Avengers are members of the village faction.</li>
<li>Avengers are seen as members of the village by the seer.</li>

<h2 data-text="Tips" class="glitch">Tips</h2>
<li>One stratefy for an avenger is to become a target. If you subtly hint that you are a powerful village role like a seer, the wolves will want to kill you, and as a result you will kill a wolf as well.</li>
