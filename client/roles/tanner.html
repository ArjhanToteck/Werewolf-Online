<h1 data-text="Tanner" class="glitch">Tanner</h1>

Tanners are forced to skin animals and make clothing for other villagers, which they hate doing. More than anything, they want to die, specifically, being hung by the other villagers. If a tanner is hung, they win the game and said game ends.

<h2 data-text="Role Type" class="glitch">Role Type</h2>
<li>Tanners are members of the village faction.</li>
<li>Tanners are seen as members of the village by the seer.</li>


<h2 data-text="Tips" class="glitch">Tips</h2>
<li>Remember, you must get killed specifically by getting voted for and hung during the day. Getting killed during the night will not make you win.</li>
<li>Pretending to be a wolf is an easy way to get hung. Just don't be too obvious, since other players won't want to have a tanner hung, as it will result in the game ending with them loosing.</li>
