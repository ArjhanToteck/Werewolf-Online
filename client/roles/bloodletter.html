<h1 data-text="Bloodletter" class="glitch">Bloodletter</h1>

Bloodletters, like all other members of the wolfpack, have the ability to communicate privately with other wolfpack members at night and kill another player every night, though only one member of the wolfpack can kill per night.

Unlike other werewolves, however, bloodletters have the ability to mark other players with wolf blood, making them indiscernible from a <a href="werewolf.html">werewolf</a> to the <a href="seer.html">seer</a>.

<h2 data-text="Additional Commands" class="glitch">Additional Commands</h2>

<li>During the night, use the command <c>!kill (username)</c> to take the wolfpack kill and murder the chosen player.</li>

<li>During the night, use the command <c>!mark (username)</c> to have a 50% chance to mark the chosen player with wolf blood. If the mark fails, the moderator will tell you privately in the morning. While marked, if a seer checks them, the target will be seen as a wolfpack member. </li>

<h2 data-text="Role Type" class="glitch">Role Type</h2>

<li>Bloodletters are members of the wolfpack faction.</li>
<li>Bloodletters are seen as members of the wolfpack by the seer.</li>

<h2 data-text="Tips" class="glitch">Tips</h2>
<li>Consider who the Seer might check at a certain night and make sure to mark them.</li>
