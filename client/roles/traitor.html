Traitors are villagers that were treated poorly and made an alliance with the wolves. They win with the wolves and can speak to the wolves at night, but cannot kill, and as a result do not count as a wolf when win conditions are calculated. Since they are human, they are also indistinguishable from regular villagers by seers.

<h2 data-text="Role Type" class="glitch">Role Type</h2>
<li>Traitors are members of the werewolf faction.</li>
<li>Tratiors are seen as members of the village by the seer.</li>

<h2 data-text="Tips" class="glitch">Tips</h2>
<li>You can verify yourself as a villager by having the seer check you.</li>
