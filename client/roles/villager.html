<h1 data-text="Villager" class="glitch">Villager</h1>

The villager is the most common role in Werewolf. A villager has no special abilities and instead must use nothing but the information they can deduce to figure out who the werewolves are and vote them off.

<li>Villagers are members of the village faction.</li>
<li>Villagers are seen as members of the village by the seer.</li>


<h2 data-text="Tips" class="glitch">Tips</h2>
<li>Just because you don't have any special abilities does not mean you're useless.</li>
<li>Don't wait for players with special abilities to save you. Try to figure things out yourself and be proactive.</li>
