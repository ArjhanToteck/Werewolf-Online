<h1 data-text="Fool" class="glitch">Fool</h1>

Fools are regular villagers that are convinced they are seers. Note that the game will tell any player who has this role that they are a seer.

<h2 data-text="Additional Commands" class="glitch">Additional Commands</h2>

<li>Every night, use the command <c>!check (username)</c> to check the faction of the chosen player. Since you aren't an actual seer, and rather a fool, the information given is no good.</li>

<h2 data-text="Role Type" class="glitch">Role Type</h2>

<li>Fools are members of the village faction.</li>
<li>Fools are seen as members of the village by the seer.</li>
