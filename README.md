# Introduction
A while ago, I made an online game called Werewolf based off of the social deduction game which I had played with my friends. It was my first online game ever, so as you can imagine, it was aweful. I didn't know anything about backend development and so the game was extremely buggy and not very fun. Now, with the experience I have gained over the last few years, remade the game.

# Basics of the Game
Werewolf is a social deduction game (no, it was not inspired by Among Us, which while it did exist at the time I made the original version of this game, it wasn't at all as popular and I didn't know it even existed). There are two teams, the village and wolfpack. The wolfpack are players hidden in the village pretending to be regular people, while during the night phase of the game, they kill innocent villagers. The village team tries to identify the wolves during the day and vote to hang them. Each team has special roles that give them different abilities.

During the game, there are two phases. A day phase, where the entire town discusses who to lynch, and the night phase were anyone with a special role can use their abilities, such as wolves killing people.

The game ends when either there are no players left alive (nobody wins), no wolves left alive (village wins), or the number of wolfpack members is greater than or equal to that of the village (wolfpack wins).

# Open Source
I made the game open source in case anyone wants to learn about the basics of developing online games or in case other people want to make their own versions and edits to the game. Just make sure to follow the MIT license.
