# Development Begins (6/16/2021)
I found an old game I made called "Werewolf" and it was made terribly. I have started developing a much better version.

# Initial Release
After four months of development, the game is now live on both [my website](https://arjhantoteck.vercel.app/werewolf/) and [Itch](https://arjhantoteck.itch.io/werewolf). I plan on adding updates in the future with new settings and roles.
